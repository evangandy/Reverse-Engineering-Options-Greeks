# Options Greeks Implementation Project

> ⚠️ **UNDER CONSTRUCTION** - Quantitative finance exploration by a high school senior

## Project Overview

A systematic implementation of options Greeks from mathematical first principles, demonstrating both theoretical understanding and practical coding skills in quantitative finance.

## Technical Approach

- **Mathematical Foundation** - Implement Black-Scholes derivatives (Greeks) using calculus-based formulas
- **Clean Implementation** - Build reusable, well-structured code components
- **Empirical Validation** - Test edge cases and verify mathematical constraints
- **Progressive Complexity** - Advance from single options to portfolio-level analysis
- **Industry Applications** - Connect mathematical concepts to real trading scenarios

## Implementation Scope

**Core Greeks Implementation:**
1. **Delta (Δ)** - First-order price sensitivity (∂C/∂S)
2. **Theta (Θ)** - Time decay analysis (∂C/∂T)  
3. **Gamma (Γ)** - Second-order convexity (∂²C/∂S²)
4. **Vega (ν)** - Volatility sensitivity (∂C/∂σ)

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Mathematical Derivation** - From Black-Scholes partial derivatives
- **Numerical Validation** - Verify analytical vs. finite difference methods
- **Boundary Testing** - Edge cases and constraint validation
- **Portfolio Extension** - Multi-position risk aggregation
- **Scenario Analysis** - Stress testing and sensitivity analysis

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Mathematical Implementation** - Translating financial theory into working code
- **Software Engineering** - Clean architecture, modular design, comprehensive testing
- **Quantitative Analysis** - Statistical validation, constraint verification, scenario modeling
- **Financial Theory** - Understanding of derivatives pricing and risk management principles

##  Context

This project is self-directed study in quantitative finance as a high school senior with calculus background.

*This is a learning project focused on building intuitive understanding of options Greeks through hands-on implementation and experimentation.*
