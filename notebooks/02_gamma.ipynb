    "## Debrief: This Was Fun But Obviously Not How Real Markets Work\n",
    "\n",
    "### What I Actually Learned About Gamma\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise really highlighted how **incredibly sensitive** gamma is to price changes. That ±$0.01 example where gamma jumped 40% shows why traders need sophisticated risk management tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Simulation Is Unrealistic\n",
    "\n",
    "**This approach is wildly inaccurate** compared to actual financial markets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Real options use complex formulas** like Black-Scholes with volatility, time decay, interest rates, and dividends\n",
    "2. **Markets involve psychology, news, and patterns** - not random number generation\n",
    "3. **Time decay constantly affects option values** (theta), which I completely ignored\n",
    "4. **Volatility sensitivity** (vega) changes option prices in ways I didn't model\n",
    "\n",
    "### But Why This Exercise Was Still Worth It\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with a basic simulation, I learned important concepts:\n",
    "- **Gamma is extremely sensitive** - way more than I expected\n",
    "- **I can see the mathematical relationships** between stock price → delta → gamma clearly\n",
    "- **The Greeks interact with each other** over time in predictable ways\n",
    "- **Real options trading requires deep understanding** of these sensitivities\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm only examining **delta and gamma** here. In future notebooks, I'll explore the other Greeks:\n",
    "- **Theta** (time decay sensitivity)\n",
    "- **Vega** (volatility sensitivity) \n",
    "- **Rho** (interest rate sensitivity)\n",
    "\n",
    "Real options pricing involves ALL the Greeks working together, so this analysis is just the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaway\n",
    "\n",
    "Gamma being a second derivative makes it much more volatile than delta. This shows why options trading requires solid mathematical foundations and why my simplified approach only scratches the surface of actual market complexity.\n"
